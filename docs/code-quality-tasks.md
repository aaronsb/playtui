# Code Quality Task List

> This document focuses on code quality improvements and technical debt management. For feature implementation tasks, see [tasks.md](tasks.md).

:heavy_check_mark: Important! Make sure between each module organization task - the parent module that exceeds our line length limit, that you run tests and commit your changes so that you can revert back to a clean state if needed.
