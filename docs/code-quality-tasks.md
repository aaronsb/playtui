# Code Quality Task List

> This document focuses on code quality improvements and technical debt management. For feature implementation tasks, see [tasks.md](tasks.md).

## Module Organization Template

When a module exceeds 150-200 lines, consider splitting it using these patterns we've established:

### Core Component Pattern
For UI components that grow too large:
- `mod.rs`: Core functionality and module organization
- `view.rs`: Rendering and display logic
- `state.rs`: State management and data structures
- `events.rs`: Event handling and processing
- `actions.rs`: Business logic and action handlers

### Event System Pattern
For complex event handling modules:
- `mod.rs`: Event system core and organization
- `handlers.rs`: Event handler implementations
- `types.rs`: Event type definitions
- `processing.rs`: Event processing pipeline logic

### Test Organization Pattern
For test modules with many cases:
- `mod.rs`: Test organization and common utilities
- `mock.rs`: Mock implementations
- `state.rs`: State-related test cases
- `events.rs`: Event handling tests
- Integration tests should be placed in separate files by feature

### Manager Pattern
For modules managing complex subsystems:
- `mod.rs`: Core management functionality
- `handlers.rs`: Specific operation handlers
- `validation.rs`: Input and state validation
- `persistence.rs`: Storage and retrieval logic

## Guidelines

1. **Commit Frequency**: Commit after each module split to maintain a clean reversion point
2. **Test Coverage**: Ensure tests are updated/added for new module structure
3. **Documentation**: Update module documentation to reflect new organization
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each file should have a clear, single purpose
5. **Cohesion**: Keep highly coupled code together, don't split for splitting's sake
6. **Error Handling**: Consolidate error types and handling in dedicated modules
7. **Dependencies**: Minimize cross-module dependencies
8. **Line Length**: Target ~150 lines per file, investigate splitting at 200+
