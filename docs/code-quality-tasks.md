- [ ] Split app/focus.rs (176 lines):
  - [ ] Create app/focus/mod.rs for core focus management
  - [ ] Create app/focus/state.rs for focus state handling
  - [ ] Create app/focus/navigation.rs for focus navigation logic
  - [ ] Create app/focus/events.rs for focus-related events

- [ ] Split app/components.rs (200 lines):
  - [ ] Create app/components/mod.rs for component management core
  - [ ] Create app/components/registry.rs for component registration
  - [ ] Create app/components/lifecycle.rs for component lifecycle
  - [ ] Create app/components/relationships.rs for component relationships

### Module Organization Guidelines
1. File Size Threshold:
   - Regular review of files exceeding 150 lines
   - Split files when they exceed 200 lines
   - Consider splitting earlier if complexity warrants it

2. Module Structure:
   - Core functionality in mod.rs
   - Separate view logic from state management
   - Isolate event handling
   - Group related functionality

3. Testing Organization:
   - Test files should mirror main code structure
   - Separate integration tests from unit tests
   - Group related test cases logically

4. Monitoring:
   - Regular line count checks using: find src -type f -name "*.rs" -exec wc -l {} \;
   - Review during code reviews
   - Track module growth over time

## Medium Priority

### Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Add unit tests for components module
- [x] Add integration tests for audio format decoders
- [x] Add playback system tests
- [x] Implement test utilities for audio format validation

### Documentation
- [ ] Add implementation details to existing TODO comments
- [ ] Document audio format specifications
- [ ] Create debugging guide for audio issues
- [ ] Update development guidelines with audio system specifics

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add position tracking for audio playback
- [ ] Optimize audio buffer management
- [ ] Implement efficient seeking in audio streams
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed audio metadata

## Low Priority

### UI Enhancements
- [ ] Complete volume slider widget
- [ ] Add visual feedback for audio seeking
- [ ] Implement hover states for controls
- [ ] Add button press animations

### Code Quality
- [ ] Review and update error messages
- [ ] Add debug logging throughout audio system
- [ ] Standardize comment formatting
- [ ] Clean up unused imports

## Monitoring Tasks

### Regular Reviews
- [ ] Weekly code quality metrics check
- [ ] Monthly review of module sizes
- [ ] Regular assessment of TODO comment status
- [ ] Performance benchmark tracking

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Keep development journal entries current
- [ ] Update architecture documentation as needed
- [ ] Maintain clear task progression records
- [ ] Document any deviations from guidelines

## Notes

- Priority levels may be adjusted based on project needs
- Tasks should be completed following OODA loop principles
- Regular reassessment of this list is recommended
- New tasks should be added as they are identified
- This list complements the main [tasks.md](tasks.md) which focuses on feature implementation
