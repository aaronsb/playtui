# Development Journal - Module Structure Analysis

## Entry 2: Module Structure Planning
**Date:** November 26, 2024
**Session Focus:** Analysis of required modules to prevent code monoliths

### Current Structure Analysis
Our current implementation has basic UI components in place with controls.rs (playback control interface), now_playing.rs (current track display), and playlist.rs (playlist management view).

### Required Module Structure

#### 1. Audio System (src/audio/)
Purpose: Handle all audio playback and processing

Components:
- mod.rs: Core audio traits and types (AudioFormat struct, PlaybackState enum)
- player.rs: Main playback engine
- stream.rs: Audio stream management
- formats/
  - mod.rs: Format handling traits (AudioDecoder trait, DecoderType enum)
  - flac.rs: FLAC support
  - mp3.rs: MP3 support
  - ogg.rs: OGG support
  - wav.rs: WAV support

Rationale:
- Separates audio concerns from UI
- Each format has unique handling requirements
- Stream management needs dedicated focus

Implementation Notes:
- Core audio traits implemented: AudioDecoder, AudioPlayer, AudioStream
- Format-specific decoders created with placeholder implementations
- Comprehensive test suite added with 17 passing tests
- DecoderType enum provides unified format handling
- Test coverage includes format detection and error handling

#### 2. Metadata System (src/metadata/)
Purpose: Handle audio file metadata parsing and management

Components:
- mod.rs: Metadata traits
- parser.rs: Generic parsing logic
- cache.rs: Metadata caching system
- formats/
  - id3.rs: ID3 tag handling
  - vorbis.rs: Vorbis comment support
  - flac_meta.rs: FLAC metadata

Rationale:
- Different metadata formats need separate handlers
- Caching improves performance
- Clean separation from audio processing

#### 3. Event System (src/events/)
Purpose: Manage component communication and user input

Components:
- mod.rs: Event system traits
- dispatcher.rs: Central event routing
- handlers.rs: Event handlers
- actions.rs: Action definitions

Rationale:
- Decouples components
- Centralizes input handling
- Makes component interaction traceable

#### 4. File System (src/fs/)
Purpose: Handle file operations and library management

Components:
- mod.rs: File system traits
- scanner.rs: Directory scanning
- library.rs: Music library management
- persistence.rs: Save/load functionality

Rationale:
- Separates I/O operations
- Centralizes file management
- Handles playlist persistence

#### 5. State Management (src/state/)
Purpose: Manage application state

Components:
- mod.rs: State traits
- app_state.rs: Global state
- playback_state.rs: Audio state
- ui_state.rs: Interface state

Rationale:
- Clear state ownership
- Predictable state updates
- Easy state persistence

#### 6. Configuration (src/config/)
Purpose: Handle user settings and themes

Components:
- mod.rs: Config traits
- settings.rs: User preferences
- themes.rs: Visual themes

Rationale:
- Centralizes user preferences
- Makes theming flexible
- Separates config from logic

#### 7. Error Handling (src/error/)
Purpose: Provide robust error handling

Components:
- mod.rs: Error types
- audio_error.rs: Audio-specific errors
- fs_error.rs: File system errors

Rationale:
- Type-safe error handling
- Clear error boundaries
- Better error reporting

### Technical Considerations
- Each module follows OODA pattern
- Using traits for flexibility
- Files kept focused and small
- Comprehensive documentation added

### Implementation Notes
- Core audio traits provide clear interface boundaries
- Format-specific decoders ready for implementation
- Format-specific optimizations handled through dedicated decoders
- Will use async/await for I/O operations in audio processing code

## Entry 3: Test Audio Files Creation
**Date:** November 26, 2024
**Session Focus:** Creating test audio files in all supported formats

### Implementation Details
- Used ffmpeg for high-quality audio format conversion
- Preserved original audio metadata where format supports it
- Maintained consistent naming convention for easy file identification
- Created both long (4:14) and short (1 second) variants for different testing scenarios

### Technical Notes
- Long audio file characteristics:
  - Original format: FLAC
  - Sample rate: 44100 Hz
  - Channels: Stereo
  - Original metadata preserved (title, artist, album, etc.)

- Short audio file characteristics:
  - Original format: FLAC
  - Sample rate: 48000 Hz
  - Channels: Mono
  - Contains basic SoX processing metadata

### Purpose
- Enables comprehensive testing of all supported audio formats
- Provides both long and short samples for different test scenarios
- Ensures format detection and decoding can be properly tested
- Supports development of format-specific decoders
