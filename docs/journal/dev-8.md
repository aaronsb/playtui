# Development Journal - Entry 8: Event Logging and Focus Handling

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive event logging system and fixed focus handling issues, particularly around tab navigation and event propagation.

## Changes Made

### Event Logging System
1. Created Logger Module
```rust
pub struct Logger {
    file: File,
}

impl Logger {
    pub fn new() -> std::io::Result<Self> {
        // Create timestamped log file
        let timestamp = SystemTime::now()
            .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
            .unwrap()
            .as_secs();
        let log_file = format!("logs/events_{}.log", timestamp);
        // ...
    }

    pub fn log_event(&mut self, event: &Event) -> std::io::Result<()> {
        // Log event with timestamp
        let timestamp = SystemTime::now()
            .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
            .unwrap()
            .as_secs();
        let log_entry = format!("[{}] Event: {:?}\n", timestamp, event);
        // ...
    }
}
```

2. Dual-Level Event Logging
   - Raw crossterm events in main.rs
   - Processed internal events in App::handle_event
   - Timestamped entries for correlation
   - Separate log files for raw and processed events

### Focus Handling Improvements
1. Event Processing Flow
   - Direct Tab/BackTab handling in App::handle_event
   - Proper conversion to Focus events
   - Immediate focus state updates

2. Error Handling
   - Added IoError variant to EventError
   - Implemented From<io::Error> for EventError
   - Proper error propagation in logging

3. Focus State Synchronization
   - Fixed initial focus state mismatch between UIState and FocusManager
   - Added focus state initialization in App::new()
   - Enhanced focus state synchronization:
   ```rust
   pub fn update_focus_states(&mut self) {
       // Sync UI state with FocusManager
       self.state.ui.focused_component = self.focus_manager.current_focus().to_string();

       // Update component focus states
       self.focus_manager.update_focus_states(
           &mut self.library_browser,
           &mut self.track_list,
           // ...
       );
   }
   ```
   - Corrected default focused component in UIState from "playlist" to "library_browser"
   - Ensured BorderType::Thick style is properly applied to focused components

## Technical Details

### Event Flow
1. Raw Event Capture
```rust
match event::read()? {
    event @ CrosstermEvent::Key(key) => {
        // Log raw event
        log_raw_event(&mut raw_logger, &event)?;
        // Process event...
    }
    // ...
}
```

2. Event Processing
```rust
pub fn handle_event(&mut self, event: Event) -> EventResult<()> {
    // Log processed event
    let _ = self.logger.log_event(&event);

    match &event {
        Event::Key(KeyEvent::Tab) => {
            self.focus_manager.handle_event(&Event::Key(
                KeyEvent::Focus(FocusDirection::Next)
            ))?;
        },
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

1. Error Handling
   - Challenge: Converting between io::Error and EventError
   - Solution: Implemented From trait for proper error conversion

2. Event Correlation
   - Challenge: Matching raw events to processed events
   - Solution: Added timestamps to both log types

3. Focus State Management
   - Challenge: Maintaining consistent focus state
   - Solution: Centralized focus handling in FocusManager

4. Focus Highlighting
   - Challenge: Initial focus not being visually highlighted
   - Solution: 
     * Fixed default focused component in UIState
     * Added immediate focus state initialization
     * Enhanced state synchronization between UIState and FocusManager

## Impact
- Better debugging capabilities through comprehensive event logs
- Improved focus handling reliability
- Cleaner error handling across the application
- Consistent visual feedback for focused components

## Next Steps
1. Add log rotation to prevent large log files
2. Implement log level filtering
3. Add more context to event logs
4. Consider adding event replay capabilities for testing
5. Add tests for focus state synchronization
6. Consider refactoring focus state management into a single source of truth
