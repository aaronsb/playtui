# Development Journal - Entry 8: Event Logging and Focus Handling

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive event logging system and fixed focus handling issues, particularly around tab navigation and event propagation.

## Changes Made

### Event Logging System
1. Created Logger Module
```rust
pub struct Logger {
    file: File,
}

impl Logger {
    pub fn new() -> std::io::Result<Self> {
        // Create timestamped log file
        let timestamp = SystemTime::now()
            .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
            .unwrap()
            .as_secs();
        let log_file = format!("logs/events_{}.log", timestamp);
        // ...
    }

    pub fn log_event(&mut self, event: &Event) -> std::io::Result<()> {
        // Log event with timestamp
        let timestamp = SystemTime::now()
            .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
            .unwrap()
            .as_secs();
        let log_entry = format!("[{}] Event: {:?}\n", timestamp, event);
        // ...
    }
}
```

2. Dual-Level Event Logging
   - Raw crossterm events in main.rs
   - Processed internal events in App::handle_event
   - Timestamped entries for correlation
   - Separate log files for raw and processed events

### Focus Handling Improvements
1. Event Processing Flow
   - Direct Tab/BackTab handling in App::handle_event
   - Proper conversion to Focus events
   - Immediate focus state updates

2. Error Handling
   - Added IoError variant to EventError
   - Implemented From<io::Error> for EventError
   - Proper error propagation in logging

## Technical Details

### Event Flow
1. Raw Event Capture
```rust
match event::read()? {
    event @ CrosstermEvent::Key(key) => {
        // Log raw event
        log_raw_event(&mut raw_logger, &event)?;
        // Process event...
    }
    // ...
}
```

2. Event Processing
```rust
pub fn handle_event(&mut self, event: Event) -> EventResult<()> {
    // Log processed event
    let _ = self.logger.log_event(&event);

    match &event {
        Event::Key(KeyEvent::Tab) => {
            self.focus_manager.handle_event(&Event::Key(
                KeyEvent::Focus(FocusDirection::Next)
            ))?;
        },
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

1. Error Handling
   - Challenge: Converting between io::Error and EventError
   - Solution: Implemented From trait for proper error conversion

2. Event Correlation
   - Challenge: Matching raw events to processed events
   - Solution: Added timestamps to both log types

3. Focus State Management
   - Challenge: Maintaining consistent focus state
   - Solution: Centralized focus handling in FocusManager

## Impact
- Better debugging capabilities through comprehensive event logs
- Improved focus handling reliability
- Cleaner error handling across the application

## Next Steps
1. Add log rotation to prevent large log files
2. Implement log level filtering
3. Add more context to event logs
4. Consider adding event replay capabilities for testing
