# Dev Diary Entry 9: Event System Refactoring

## Issue
The application was experiencing CPU spikes and potential infinite loops when using arrow keys for navigation. This was caused by several issues in the event handling system:

1. Double Event Processing:
   - Components were processing events in both `handle_event()` and `update()`
   - Navigation actions were being converted back to events creating loops
   - Multiple components could process the same navigation events

2. Recursive Action Processing:
   - Actions were being processed recursively leading to mutable borrow issues
   - No tracking of processed actions leading to potential infinite loops
   - Inefficient event propagation through components

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive refactoring of the event handling system:

### 1. Component Manager Changes
```rust
pub fn update_components(&mut self, action: Action) {
    let mut pending_actions = vec![action];
    let mut processed_actions = Vec::new();

    while let Some(current_action) = pending_actions.pop() {
        // Skip if already processed
        if processed_actions.contains(&current_action) {
            continue;
        }
        processed_actions.push(current_action.clone());

        // Process through components
        if let Some(event) = Self::action_to_event(&current_action) {
            for component in &mut self.components {
                if let Ok(Some(follow_up)) = component.handle_event(&event) {
                    if !matches!(follow_up, Action::Refresh) && 
                       !processed_actions.contains(&follow_up) {
                        pending_actions.push(follow_up);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Key improvements:
- Separated action-to-event conversion
- Added action tracking to prevent loops
- Removed recursive processing
- Improved event filtering

### 2. TrackList Component Changes
```rust
fn handle_event(&mut self, event: Event) -> Option<Action> {
    // Only handle events if component is focused
    if !self.focused() {
        return match event {
            Event::System(_) => Some(Action::Refresh),
            _ => None,
        };
    }

    match event {
        Event::Key(key_event) => {
            match key_event {
                KeyEvent::Up => {
                    if self.tracks.is_empty() {
                        return None;
                    }
                    // Navigation logic...
                    Some(Action::Refresh)
                },
                // Other key handlers...
            }
        },
        _ => None,
    }
}
```

Improvements:
- Added proper focus checking
- Added empty list validation
- Removed duplicate navigation logic
- Enhanced bounds checking

## Event Flow
The new event processing flow is more linear and controlled:
1. Action received by ComponentManager
2. Action converted to Event once
3. Event processed by focused component
4. New actions added to queue if not previously processed
5. Process continues until queue is empty

## Testing
Added new tests to verify:
- Focus-based event handling
- Empty list navigation
- Bounds checking
- Action propagation
- Component independence

All tests are passing, including component integration tests.

## Lessons Learned
1. Importance of tracking processed actions to prevent loops
2. Need for clear focus management in event handling
3. Benefits of separating event handling from state updates
4. Value of comprehensive test coverage for complex interactions

## Next Steps
1. Monitor CPU usage during navigation
2. Consider adding event logging for debugging
3. Look into optimizing action-to-event conversion
4. Consider adding event throttling if needed
