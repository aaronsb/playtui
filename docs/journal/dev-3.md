# Development Journal - State and Event System Implementation

## Entry 3: Component Event System Implementation
**Date:** November 26, 2024
**Session Focus:** Implementing state management and event handling system

### Implemented Components

1. Event System (src/events/mod.rs):
- Created Event enum for Key, Mouse, and System events
- Implemented Action system for component communication
- Added event types for playback control, UI updates, and metadata handling
- Added proper error handling with EventError and EventResult types
- Optimized event dispatch with filtering to reduce cloning

2. State Management (src/state/mod.rs):
- Implemented AppState with dedicated states for:
  - Player state (playback, volume, position)
  - Playlist state (tracks, selection)
  - UI state (theme, focus, window size)
  - Metadata state (current track info, cache)
- Added state update system with follow-up action support

3. Component Architecture:
- Enhanced Component trait with:
  - Event handling
  - State management
  - Focus control
  - Rendering
- Added ComponentState for shared component functionality
- Implemented base components:
  - Playlist: Track selection and scrolling
  - NowPlaying: Track info and progress display
  - Controls: Playback control interface

### Resolved Issues

1. Mouse Event Handling:
- Fixed crossterm mouse event mapping
- Proper handling of MouseEventKind variants
- Implemented click and scroll support
- Added error handling for mouse events

2. Component Implementation:
- Completed Playlist functionality:
  - Track selection and management
  - Scroll navigation
  - Focus handling
- Completed NowPlaying display:
  - Current track info
  - Progress and volume bars
- Completed Controls implementation:
  - Basic playback controls
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Visual feedback

3. Event Dispatch:
- Optimized event dispatch to avoid unnecessary cloning
- Added event filtering at dispatch level
- Improved error handling and propagation

### Technical Decisions

1. Event Ownership:
- Pass Event by reference in handle_event
- Components take ownership of actions they generate
- App handles event dispatch and error management

2. Component State:
- Using ComponentState struct for shared state
- Each component maintains its own focused state
- Components implement Clone + Send + 'static

3. Focus Management:
- Centralized focus control in App
- UI state tracks focused component
- Components check focus before handling events

### Next Steps

1. Implementation Tasks:
- [x] Fix mouse event handling in main.rs
- [x] Complete component-specific functionality
- [x] Add proper error handling for events
- [ ] Implement actual audio playback integration

2. Testing Requirements:
- [x] Basic event handling tests
- [x] Component state management tests
- [x] Focus system behavior tests
- [ ] Add comprehensive event dispatch tests
- [ ] Add component integration tests

3. Documentation Needs:
- [ ] Document event flow patterns
- [ ] Add component API documentation
- [ ] Create event handling guidelines
- [ ] Update architecture documentation

### Notes
- All current tests are passing
- Event system provides good separation of concerns
- State management system supports complex state transitions
- UI layout efficiently utilizes available space (60/20/20 split)
- Focus system provides clear visual feedback
