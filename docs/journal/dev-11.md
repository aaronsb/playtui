## Module Organization Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Split app/components.rs into modular structure:
   - app/components/mod.rs - Core component management
   - app/components/registry.rs - Component registration
   - app/components/lifecycle.rs - Component lifecycle
   - app/components/relationships.rs - Component relationships

2. Split app/mod.rs into focused modules:
   - app/state.rs - Application state management
   - app/initialization.rs - Startup logic
   - app/lifecycle.rs - Application lifecycle management

### Design Decisions
1. Rendering Logic Location
   - Decision: Keep rendering logic in ui.rs instead of creating app/rendering.rs
   - Rationale:
     * Current ui.rs is well-organized and focused
     * Clear separation between UI presentation (ui.rs) and application logic (app/)
     * Follows single responsibility principle
     * Current implementation doesn't exceed line length limits
     * Moving to app/rendering.rs would blur the boundary between UI and app logic

2. Module Organization Strategy
   - Following OODA-based development guidelines
   - Maintaining clear module boundaries
   - Keeping mod.rs files focused and minimal
   - Separating concerns into logical units

### Next Steps
1. Continue with high-priority module organization tasks:
   - Split components/library_browser.rs (251 lines)
   - Split components/track_list.rs (298 lines)
   - Split components/tests.rs (237 lines)

### Testing Status
- All tests passing (70 passed, 0 failed, 3 ignored)
- Integration tests successful
- No regressions from module reorganization

### Notes
- Some non-critical warnings about unused imports and variables
- Module organization improving code maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns achieved in app module structure
