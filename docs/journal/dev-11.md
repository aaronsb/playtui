# Dev Journal Entry 11: Fixed Library Browser Selection Movement

## Issue
The library browser's selection highlight was not moving when using arrow keys for navigation. While events were being processed correctly, the visual state wasn't updating to reflect the selection changes.

## Analysis
Investigation revealed two key issues:
1. In FSState::set_entries, the selection was being reset to 0 on every refresh
2. The event handling chain was properly updating the state but the visual feedback wasn't reflecting these changes

Event logs showed proper event processing:
```
Event: Key(Down)
Debug: Current focus: library_browser
Debug: Processing frame-specific event for library_browser: Key(Down)
Debug: Component should process event
Debug: Generated action: Key(Down)
Debug: Component generated follow-up action: NavigateDown
```

## Fix
Modified src/components/filesystem/mod.rs to:
1. Preserve selection state when updating entries:
```rust
pub fn set_entries(&mut self, entries: Vec<FSEntry>) {
    self.entries = entries;
    // Only set initial selection if there isn't one already
    if self.selected_index.is_none() {
        self.selected_index = if self.entries.is_empty() { None } else { Some(0) };
    }
    // Ensure selection is still valid after changing entries
    if let Some(index) = self.selected_index {
        if index >= self.entries.len() {
            self.selected_index = if self.entries.is_empty() { None } else { Some(0) };
        }
    }
}
```

2. Reset selection only when explicitly navigating to a new directory:
```rust
pub fn navigate_to(&mut self, path: PathBuf) {
    self.current_dir = path;
    // Reset selection when changing directories
    self.selected_index = Some(0);
    self.entries.clear();
}
```

## Testing
- Verified arrow up/down moves selection highlight
- Confirmed enter expands folders correctly
- Checked selection resets appropriately when entering new directories
- Event logs show proper state updates and visual feedback

## Lessons Learned
1. State management needs to carefully consider when to reset vs preserve state
2. Visual feedback is crucial for user interaction
3. Event logs help verify the system is working as expected even when visual feedback isn't

## Next Steps
- Consider adding visual feedback for failed navigation attempts
- Add automated tests for navigation state management
- Document the state preservation patterns in the architecture docs
