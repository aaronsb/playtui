# Dev Journal Entry 10: Fixed Player Controls Navigation

## Issue
The player controls frame was not responding correctly to left/right navigation events. Investigation of the event logs revealed that these events were being treated as global navigation events, resulting in NavigateLeft/NavigateRight actions instead of updating the focused button within the controls frame.

## Analysis
The issue was in src/components/controls/events.rs where Left/Right key events were being handled at the top level of the handle_event function, causing them to be treated as global navigation events regardless of focus state. This prevented proper button-to-button navigation within the controls frame.

Event logs showed:
```
[Before]
Event: Key(Right)
Debug: Generated action: NavigateRight
Debug: Component generated follow-up action: NavigateRight
```

## Fix
Modified src/components/controls/events.rs to:
1. Remove Left/Right from being treated as global navigation events
2. Make all key events require focus
3. Move Left/Right key event handling into the focused key event match block
4. Return Refresh action after updating button focus

Event logs after fix:
```
[After]
Event: Key(Right)
Debug: Processing frame-specific event for controls: Key(Right)
Debug: Component should process event
Debug: Generated action: Key(Right)
Debug: Component generated follow-up action: Refresh
```

## Testing
- Verified focus properly moves between frames using Tab
- Confirmed Left/Right navigation works within controls frame when focused
- Event logs show proper event handling and focus management

## Lessons Learned
1. Event handling hierarchy is important - frame-specific events should be handled differently than global events
2. Focus state should be checked before processing frame-specific events
3. Event logs are crucial for debugging event flow issues

## Next Steps
- Consider similar focus-based event handling patterns in other components
- Add automated tests for focus-based navigation
- Document the event handling patterns in the architecture docs
