# Development Journal - TUI Music Player

## Entry 1: Initial Project Scaffolding
**Date:** November 25, 2024
**Session Focus:** Project initialization and basic architecture setup

### Accomplishments
- Created new Rust project with cargo init
- Set up project dependencies:
  - ratatui for TUI framework
  - crossterm for terminal handling and input management
- Implemented component-based architecture with three main components:
  - Playlist view (60% height)
  - Now Playing view (25% height)
  - Controls view (15% height)
- Established modular code structure:
  - Created component trait for shared behavior
  - Implemented separate modules for each component
  - Set up ui.rs for layout management
  - Created app.rs for application state management

### Technical Details
#### Component Structure
- Created base `Component` trait in `components/mod.rs`
- Each component module (`playlist.rs`, `now_playing.rs`, `controls.rs`) implements:
  - Basic rendering logic
  - State management
  - Default trait
- All components are properly encapsulated with public interfaces

#### Navigation System
- Implemented basic frame navigation:
  - Tab: cycle forward through frames
  - Shift+Tab: cycle backward through frames
  - 'q': quit application
- Added visual feedback with yellow highlighting for focused frame

### Current Status
- Basic application scaffold is running successfully
- Component architecture is in place with proper visibility modifiers
- Frame navigation and focus system working as expected

### Notes
- Consider adding error handling for component initialization
- May need to optimize frame rendering for larger playlists
- Should document the component trait interface for future contributors

### Technical Questions Under Consideration
- Format for storing music library data
- Playlist persistence strategy
- Configuration file structure for user preferences
