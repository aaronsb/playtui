# Development Journal - TUI Music Player

## Entry 1: Initial Project Scaffolding
**Date:** November 25, 2024
**Session Focus:** Project initialization and basic architecture setup

### Accomplishments
- Created new Rust project with cargo init
- Set up project dependencies:
  - ratatui for TUI framework
  - crossterm for terminal handling and input management
- Implemented component-based architecture with three main components:
  - Playlist view (60% height)
  - Now Playing view (25% height)
  - Controls view (15% height)
- Established modular code structure:
  - Created component trait for shared behavior
  - Implemented separate modules for each component
  - Set up ui.rs for layout management
  - Created app.rs for application state management

### Technical Details
#### Component Structure
- Created base `Component` trait in `components/mod.rs`
- Each component module (`playlist.rs`, `now_playing.rs`, `controls.rs`) implements:
  - Basic rendering logic
  - State management
  - Default trait
- All components are properly encapsulated with public interfaces

#### Navigation System
- Implemented basic frame navigation:
  - Tab: cycle forward through frames
  - Shift+Tab: cycle backward through frames
  - 'q': quit application
- Added visual feedback with yellow highlighting for focused frame

### Current Status
- Basic application scaffold is running successfully
- Component architecture is in place with proper visibility modifiers
- Frame navigation and focus system working as expected

### Next Steps
1. Implement specific functionality for each component as per project backlog
2. Add music library management to Playlist component
3. Develop playback controls in Controls component
4. Create now playing view with track information display
5. Implement actual music playback integration

### Notes
- Consider adding error handling for component initialization
- May need to optimize frame rendering for larger playlists
- Should document the component trait interface for future contributors

### Open Questions
- What format should we use for storing music library data?
- How should we handle playlist persistence?
- Do we need a configuration file for user preferences?
