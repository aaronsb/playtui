# Development Journal - Entry 5: Theme System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive theme system based on the monokai color scheme. This includes theme loading, component integration, and style management.

## Completed Tasks
From tasks.md:
- [x] Set up basic theme support (Configuration)
- [x] Add focus system with visual feedback (UIComponent)
- [x] Create component layout structure (UIComponent)

## Implementation Details

### Theme System Structure
1. Theme Loading
   - JSON-based theme files
   - Support for both hex (#RRGGBB) and named colors
   - Serde for serialization/deserialization
   - Error handling for invalid themes

2. Theme Components
   - ThemeMetadata: name, author, version
   - Colors: primary, secondary, background, etc.
   - Styles: borders, text, buttons, lists, etc.
   - StyleConfig: flexible style definitions with optional fields

3. Component Integration
   - Updated Component trait with theme support
   - Theme-aware render methods
   - Consistent styling across all components
   - Focus state visual feedback

### Key Features
1. Color Management
   - Global background color
   - Consistent color palette
   - Semantic color naming
   - Color parsing with error handling

2. Style System
   - Border styles (focused/unfocused)
   - Text styles (normal/bold/dim)
   - List highlighting
   - Interactive element styles

3. Component Styling
   - Library browser with selection highlighting
   - Playback controls with focus states
   - Volume control with status indication
   - Track list with playing indicator

## Technical Notes
- Theme loading is handled at app initialization
- Components receive theme reference during render
- Style application is consistent across the UI
- Error handling for theme loading failures

## Next Steps
1. Theme Configuration
   - [ ] User preferences management
   - [ ] Theme configuration UI
   - [ ] Theme hot-reloading

2. Theme Extensions
   - [ ] High contrast themes
   - [ ] Custom theme creation
