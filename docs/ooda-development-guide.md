# OODA Loop Development Guide

## Overview
This guide integrates the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) decision-making process with component-based architecture development. The goal is to create more responsive, adaptable, and maintainable TUI applications.

## Component OODA Cycle Implementation

### Observe Phase
The Observe phase focuses on data collection and event monitoring.

```rust
pub trait ObservableComponent {
    /// Collects and processes incoming events and state changes
    fn observe(&self) -> Vec<Event> {
        vec![] // Default implementation
    }
    
    /// Monitors component-specific metrics
    fn collect_metrics(&self) -> ComponentMetrics {
        ComponentMetrics::default()
    }
}

#[derive(Default)]
struct ComponentMetrics {
    update_frequency: f64,
    event_queue_size: usize,
    render_time_ms: f64,
}
```

### Orient Phase
The Orient phase analyzes collected data and current component state.

```rust
pub trait OrientableComponent {
    /// Analyzes current state and events to determine context
    fn analyze_context(&self, events: Vec<Event>) -> ComponentContext;
    
    /// Evaluates component health and performance
    fn evaluate_health(&self, metrics: ComponentMetrics) -> ComponentHealth;
}

struct ComponentContext {
    state_snapshot: HashMap<String, Value>,
    event_patterns: Vec<EventPattern>,
    dependencies: Vec<ComponentDependency>,
}
```

### Decide Phase
The Decide phase determines appropriate actions based on analysis.

```rust
pub trait DecisionMakingComponent {
    /// Determines next actions based on context
    fn decide_action(&self, context: ComponentContext) -> Action;
    
    /// Prioritizes multiple potential actions
    fn prioritize_actions(&self, actions: Vec<Action>) -> Vec<Action>;
}
```

### Act Phase
The Act phase executes decided actions and updates state.

```rust
pub trait ActionableComponent {
    /// Executes determined actions
    fn execute_action(&mut self, action: Action) -> Result<(), Error>;
    
    /// Updates component state based on action results
    fn update_state(&mut self, result: ActionResult);
}
```

## Implementation Goals

### Immediate Goals
1. Component Independence
   - Each component should maintain its own OODA cycle
   - Minimize inter-component dependencies
   - Clear interfaces for component communication

2. State Management
   - Immutable state updates
   - Clear state transition paths
   - State history for debugging

3. Event Handling
   - Priority-based event processing
   - Event filtering and transformation
   - Event correlation across components

### Medium-term Goals
1. Performance Optimization
   - Lazy component updates
   - Event batching
   - Render caching

2. Testing Infrastructure
   - Component isolation testing
   - OODA cycle verification
   - State transition testing

### Long-term Goals
1. System Evolution
   - Component hot-reloading
   - Dynamic component composition
   - Automated performance optimization
