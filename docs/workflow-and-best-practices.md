# Workflow and Best Practices Guide

## Development Workflow

### 1. Component Planning
- Define component responsibilities
- Map OODA cycle requirements
- Identify state requirements

### 2. Implementation
- Build OODA infrastructure
- Implement component logic
- Add logging and metrics

### 3. Testing
- Unit tests for each OODA phase
- Integration tests for full cycles
- Performance benchmarking

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- Main branch (`main`) represents production-ready state
- Development branch (`develop`) for active development
- Feature branches branch off from `develop`
- Example naming: `feature/preferences-persistence`

### Commit Guidelines
- Commit only working code to maintain stability
- Each commit should represent a logical unit of change
- Write clear commit messages describing the change
- Example message: "feat(preferences): implement settings persistence"

### Pull Request Flow
- Create PR from feature branch to `develop` when feature reaches MVP
- Example: Preferences feature PR when it can:
  * Load user preferences
  * Save preference changes
  * Demonstrate basic functionality
- PR should include:
  * Clear description of changes
  * List of implemented functionality
  * Any known limitations
  * Test coverage details

### Feature Completion Criteria
- Feature must be functionally complete (MVP)
- All tests must pass
- Code must compile without errors
- Example: Preferences feature ready when:
  * Settings persist between sessions
  * Basic preferences UI works
  * Error handling is in place
  * Core functionality is tested

### Code Review Process
- Review focuses on:
  * Code quality and style
  * Test coverage
  * Performance considerations
  * Security implications
- Address review feedback promptly
- Maintain discussion in PR comments

## Best Practices

### 1. Error Handling
- Graceful degradation
- Error recovery strategies
- Error logging and metrics

### 2. Performance
- Optimize OODA cycle frequency
- Batch similar actions
- Cache frequently accessed state

### 3. Maintenance
- Regular metric review
- Component health monitoring
- Technical debt management

### 4. Code Quality
- Follow Rust idioms and best practices
- Use consistent formatting (rustfmt)
- Document public APIs
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Regular code reviews

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Write tests alongside code
- Focus on behavior, not implementation
- Use meaningful test names
- Keep tests maintainable
- Aim for high coverage of critical paths
