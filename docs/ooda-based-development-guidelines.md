# Component Architecture OODA Loop Development Guide

## Overview
This guide integrates the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) decision-making process with component-based architecture development. The goal is to create more responsive, adaptable, and maintainable TUI applications.

## 1. Component OODA Cycle Implementation

### Observe Phase
The Observe phase focuses on data collection and event monitoring.

```rust
pub trait ObservableComponent {
    /// Collects and processes incoming events and state changes
    fn observe(&self) -> Vec<Event> {
        vec![] // Default implementation
    }
    
    /// Monitors component-specific metrics
    fn collect_metrics(&self) -> ComponentMetrics {
        ComponentMetrics::default()
    }
}

#[derive(Default)]
struct ComponentMetrics {
    update_frequency: f64,
    event_queue_size: usize,
    render_time_ms: f64,
}
```

### Orient Phase
The Orient phase analyzes collected data and current component state.

```rust
pub trait OrientableComponent {
    /// Analyzes current state and events to determine context
    fn analyze_context(&self, events: Vec<Event>) -> ComponentContext;
    
    /// Evaluates component health and performance
    fn evaluate_health(&self, metrics: ComponentMetrics) -> ComponentHealth;
}

struct ComponentContext {
    state_snapshot: HashMap<String, Value>,
    event_patterns: Vec<EventPattern>,
    dependencies: Vec<ComponentDependency>,
}
```

### Decide Phase
The Decide phase determines appropriate actions based on analysis.

```rust
pub trait DecisionMakingComponent {
    /// Determines next actions based on context
    fn decide_action(&self, context: ComponentContext) -> Action;
    
    /// Prioritizes multiple potential actions
    fn prioritize_actions(&self, actions: Vec<Action>) -> Vec<Action>;
}
```

### Act Phase
The Act phase executes decided actions and updates state.

```rust
pub trait ActionableComponent {
    /// Executes determined actions
    fn execute_action(&mut self, action: Action) -> Result<(), Error>;
    
    /// Updates component state based on action results
    fn update_state(&mut self, result: ActionResult);
}
```

## 2. Implementation Goals

### Immediate Goals
1. Component Independence
   - Each component should maintain its own OODA cycle
   - Minimize inter-component dependencies
   - Clear interfaces for component communication

2. State Management
   - Immutable state updates
   - Clear state transition paths
   - State history for debugging

3. Event Handling
   - Priority-based event processing
   - Event filtering and transformation
   - Event correlation across components

### Medium-term Goals
1. Performance Optimization
   - Lazy component updates
   - Event batching
   - Render caching

2. Testing Infrastructure
   - Component isolation testing
   - OODA cycle verification
   - State transition testing

### Long-term Goals
1. System Evolution
   - Component hot-reloading
   - Dynamic component composition
   - Automated performance optimization

## 3. Implementation Example

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

/// Complete component implementation incorporating OODA
pub struct OODAComponent {
    state: ComponentState,
    metrics: ComponentMetrics,
    context: ComponentContext,
    config: ComponentConfig,
}

impl OODAComponent {
    pub fn new(config: ComponentConfig) -> Self {
        Self {
            state: ComponentState::default(),
            metrics: ComponentMetrics::default(),
            context: ComponentContext::default(),
            config,
        }
    }

    /// Main OODA loop execution
    pub fn execute_cycle(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // Observe
        let events = self.observe();
        self.metrics = self.collect_metrics();

        // Orient
        self.context = self.analyze_context(events);
        let health = self.evaluate_health(self.metrics.clone());

        // Decide
        let action = self.decide_action(self.context.clone());
        let prioritized_actions = self.prioritize_actions(vec![action]);

        // Act
        for action in prioritized_actions {
            self.execute_action(action)?;
        }

        Ok(())
    }
}

impl Component for OODAComponent {
    fn init(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        // Initialize component with OODA infrastructure
        Ok(())
    }

    fn handle_events(&mut self, event: Option<Event>) -> Action {
        // Integrate event handling with OODA cycle
        self.execute_cycle()
            .map(|_| Action::Noop)
            .unwrap_or(Action::Error)
    }

    fn update(&mut self, action: Action) -> Action {
        // Update state based on OODA cycle results
        self.state.apply_action(action);
        Action::Noop
    }

    fn render(&mut self, f: &mut Frame, rect: Rect) {
        // Render based on current state
        // Implementation details...
    }
}
```

## 4. Development Process Guidelines

### Design Principles
1. Single Responsibility
   - Each component handles one specific aspect of functionality
   - OODA cycles are contained within component boundaries

2. Immutability
   - State changes through explicit actions only
   - Event history preservation

3. Testability
   - Each OODA phase should be independently testable
   - Clear state transitions

4. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
   - Extract common functionality into shared utilities
   - Create reusable components and traits
   - Maintain consistent patterns across similar features
   - Example: Using a shared block creation function for UI components
   - Benefits:
     * Reduces maintenance burden
     * Ensures consistency
     * Makes updates easier
     * Reduces potential for bugs

### Development Workflow
1. Component Planning
   - Define component responsibilities
   - Map OODA cycle requirements
   - Identify state requirements

2. Implementation
   - Build OODA infrastructure
   - Implement component logic
   - Add logging and metrics

3. Testing
   - Unit tests for each OODA phase
   - Integration tests for full cycles
   - Performance benchmarking

### Best Practices
1. Error Handling
   - Graceful degradation
   - Error recovery strategies
   - Error logging and metrics

2. Performance
   - Optimize OODA cycle frequency
   - Batch similar actions
   - Cache frequently accessed state

3. Maintenance
   - Regular metric review
   - Component health monitoring
   - Technical debt management

4. Module Organization
   - Keep mod.rs files focused and minimal
   - Split large mod.rs files into dedicated modules
   - Follow the "Rule of Three":
     * When a mod.rs contains more than three major components
     * When a mod.rs exceeds 125 lines
     * When a mod.rs handles multiple distinct responsibilities
   - Maintain clear module boundaries:
     * mod.rs should primarily contain exports and core traits
     * Complex implementations belong in separate files
     * Group related functionality into sub-modules
   - Regular module health checks:
     * Review mod.rs complexity during code reviews
     * Monitor module growth patterns
     * Refactor early when signs of bloat appear

5. General Organization
   - Keep .rs files focused
   - Where possible, split .rs files into dedicated modules or purposes
   - Follow the "Rule of Three":
     * When a .rs contains more than three major features
     * When a .rs file exceeds 150 lines
     * When a .rs handles multiple distinct responsibilities
     
6. Stability Hygiene
   - After completion of modifications or changes
     * Run cargo test
     * Follow up with major errors
     * Understand warnings might be ok
     * Avoid the temptation to remove unused code - it may be placeholder for future functions

## 5. Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics
1. Cycle Time
   - Full OODA cycle duration
   - Individual phase durations
   - Action execution time

2. Health Indicators
   - Event queue size
   - State update frequency
   - Error rates

3. Performance Metrics
   - Memory usage
   - CPU utilization
   - Render time

4. Module Metrics
   - Lines of code in mod.rs files
   - Number of exports per module
   - Module dependency counts

### Monitoring Implementation
```rust
pub struct ComponentMonitor {
    metrics: HashMap<String, MetricValue>,
    thresholds: HashMap<String, ThresholdConfig>,
}

impl ComponentMonitor {
    pub fn record_metric(&mut self, key: &str, value: MetricValue) {
        self.metrics.insert(key.to_string(), value);
    }

    pub fn check_health(&self) -> ComponentHealth {
        // Implementation details...
        ComponentHealth::default()
    }
}
```
