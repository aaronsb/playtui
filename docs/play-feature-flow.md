# Play Feature Flow Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the play feature's user interaction flow using the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop paradigm. The flow is designed to mirror natural human behavior when interacting with music players.

## User Flow OODA Mapping

- Select initial playlist ordering

**Act:**
- Load music library
- Display main interface
- Present quick-access controls

### 2. Music Selection
**Observe:**

### 4. Session Management
**Observe:**
- User activity/inactivity
- System events
- Session duration

**Orient:**
- Track session state
- Monitor system resources
- Maintain playback history

**Decide:**
- Determine session persistence
- Choose state saving frequency
- Select recovery points

**Act:**
- Save session state
- Persist playback position
- Store user preferences
